\section{Research Question}

The results in chapter \ref{results} outlined in detail several aspects identified from the three interviews carried out at the case project. These results will be further discussed in this chapter, focusing on comparing the results with appropriate theory and literature mainly described in chapter \ref{theory}. The discussion will revolve around the research question for the master thesis:
